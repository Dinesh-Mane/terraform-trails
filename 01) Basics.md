# What is Terraform?
Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp.  
It allows users to define and provision infrastructure in a declarative configuration language. --> **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)**
With Terraform, you can describe the desired state of your infrastructure, including resources such as virtual machines, networks, and storage, in code.  
Terraform then automates the process of provisioning and managing these resources, enabling infrastructure changes through version-controlled configuration files.  

**Simple Definition:** Terraform is a tool that lets you define cloud infrastructure (like servers, networks, databases) in code, and then automatically create and manage it using that code.
